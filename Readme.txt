There are 5 levels from very easy to hard (not very hard :)) ).

Rule to play: Move the blank grid until getting a complete picture.

The less time it takes, the better score is.

INSTRUCTION will be displayed on waiting screen.

To RUN code, there must be:
	- C++ 11 or later
	- SDL2-2.0.5
	- SDL2_ttf-2.0.15

To PLAY, just open 'Application_QuickQuick.zip' and run 'QuickQuick.exe'.

Enjoy it :D
